## Install

Login to your dashboard at [https://sysward.com/dashboard](https://sysward.com/dashboard) and navigate to the
[Install Agent](https://sysward.com/dashboard) page.

From there you will see instructions with your API key to run on your systems, similar to below but with your key there.

```bash
curl https://sysward.com/install.sh | API_KEY=KEYHERE bash
```

Once this is run you should see your server reporting in to the dashboard.
